  arq.py: ARQ implementations in Python, using Gevent
=======================================================

Description
===========

This project is a training exercise.  It's intended to help me learn about
reliable data transfers by implementing various ARQ_ protocols.  I'm writing
them in Python to learn more about concurrency in Gevent.

The code is meant to be more readable than reliable or performant.  Please do
not use this to build a DIY TCP-over-UDP in any serious application :-)
